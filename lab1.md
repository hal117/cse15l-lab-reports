# Remote access and FileSystem tutorial
Hello incoming 15l UCSD students! During lab1 many students including myself had to do three things:
1. Install VScode
2. Remotely connect
3. Figure out how to use commands

In this tutorial, I'm to take you through this process so you're experience is smooth and simple.

# Installing VScode
First, head over to the Visual Studio [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download the version that is compatible with your device (macOS, 
windows, etc).

When it is installed, a window should open up a home page that looks similar to this:

You're all set with installing VScode, you can start coding all your fancy projects, but now we're going to move on!
